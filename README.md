## My process
HTML
- firstly i created a wrapper called "con" to wrapp the whole work so i couls use grid on it 
- I also then created sub-container called "t1,t2,t3" respectively so i could be able to grid to arrange them in columes and rows for responsive layout
- I also created a div inside the "t1 t2 t3" and named them "wrapper1 wrapper 2, wrapper3" respectively 
- Inside my wrapper div i inserted svg-tag,h1-tag, p-tag, and button tag 
CSS
- I made use of grid to arrange my design 
- I also made use of media qureis to make the work look responsive
